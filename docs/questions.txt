Single Cycle Processor Questions

- BGEZ, BGEZAL, BGTZ, BLEZ, BLTZ, BLTZAL, different from BEQ and BNE because they do not need the ALU.  In our implementation, we have a Branch Helper that takes the ALU result, as well as the B input to the ALU.  Is this necessary?  Should the ALU have a short from the B input to the ALU output?

- what is the difference between LB and LBU? 

- How is MUL implemented in a Single Cycle Processor?  Should it support signed and unsigned values?  Or just unsigned values?

- Instruction Fetch Logic involves fetching the next instruction from memory.  Will we use a separate mem.vhd component for the instruction memory? 
	No I think.

- are the rs and rt labeled correctly on my diagram?

- do I have the right idea with the link helper module?

- What do we do with the Overflow Trap signal?

- Does the ALU need to do anything for BGEZ or BGTZ?  Does it need to subtract for BEQ?

- Do you have your example for the control module you shared in class?  Did you use a with select or case select?  how did you combine your signals to make the code easier to read and write?

- how/can/should we specify 'dont cares' in our control module signals?

Our signals:
	ALUOp
	MemWrite
	ALUSrc
	RegWrite
	MemToReg
	Branch
	Jump
	RegDst (rt or rd goes to waddr)
	Overflow Trap?
	AndLink
	Storetype
	Loadtype
	load_sign_en
	UseResultForBranch???
