Single Cycle Processor Questions

- BGEZ, BGEZAL, BGTZ, BLEZ, BLTZ, BLTZAL, different from BEQ and BNE because they do not need the ALU.  In our implementation, we have a Branch Helper that takes the ALU result.  

- what is the difference between LB and LBU? 

- How is MUL implemented in a Single Cycle Processor?

- Instruction Fetch Logic involves fetching the next instruction from memory.  Will we use a separate mem.vhd component for the instruction memory?
